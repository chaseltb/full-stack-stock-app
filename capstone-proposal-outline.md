- Wireframes
- Database Schema

## Proposal Outline / Example 

## Problem Statement

Context: Briefly describe the context or environment in which the problem exists. Who are the primary users or groups affected? What is the scope of the issue?

Core Problem: What specific, unmet need or challenge does this project address? Explain in simple terms what is currently missing, difficult, or ineffective for users.

Impact on Users: Describe how this problem affects the users or stakeholders. What pain points do they experience as a result of this issue? What specific frustrations, inefficiencies, or missed opportunities arise from the current situation?

Opportunity for Solution: Why is solving this problem meaningful for your intended audience? How would a solution add value to their experience or address their needs in a unique way?

## Technical Solution 

Overview of the Solution: Describe the high-level approach you plan to take to solve the problem outlined in your Problem Statement. What kind of application or system will you create? How will it address the core problem?

Key Features and Functionalities: List and describe the main features of the application. What are the critical functionalities that users will need to perform in order to effectively interact with the system?

User Scenarios: Explain how the technical solution will support different user needs. Provide two to three specific use cases or scenarios that illustrate how users (e.g., runners, club admins) will interact with the system and what value they will gain from each interaction.

Technology Stack: Briefly mention the key technologies, frameworks, and tools you will use to build the application. Why did you choose these tools, and how will they help you achieve your solution?

## Glossary

In this section, you'll define key terms used within your application. Providing clear and consistent definitions for each term ensures that everyone on your team has a common understanding of the concepts. This is essential not only for your project's success but also for communicating effectively with stakeholders.

## High Level Requirements

- Manage **6–10 database tables (entities)** that are independent concepts. A simple bridge table doesn't count.  
- **MySQL** for data management.  
- **Spring Boot, MVC, JDBC, Testing, React**.  
- An HTML and CSS UI that's built with React.  
- Sensible layering and pattern choices.  
- A full backend test suite that covers the domain and data layers (unit + integration).  
- Must have at least **2 roles** (example: User and Admin).  
- Must provide an **OpenAPI/Swagger specification** documenting all endpoints.  
- Must be **hosted on a cloud provider** (AWS, Azure, or GCP).  

In this section, you will outline how you plan to meet the high-level requirements of your project. For each requirement, explain the specific steps you will take, the tools or technologies you will use, and how you'll implement them to meet the project’s objectives.

## User Stories

In this section, you will outline how each user story will be implemented in your application. For each user story, explain the user’s goals, the actions they will take, the preconditions required for each action, and the postconditions that follow. This will help clarify how you plan to meet the functional needs of the project.

## Learning Goals (Mandatory: 3 minimum)

- Each team must select **at least three learning goals** outside of the technologies covered in class.  
- Each learning goal must directly improve the project.  
- Document for each goal:  
  - What you learned,  
  - Where it is applied in the project,  
  - Challenges faced,  
  - Resources used.  

Example:

Learning Goal: I want to learn how to integrate Google Maps into a web application.

Application: I will use Google Maps API to display the location of each run on an interactive map within the app.  
Research and Resources: I’ll start with the official Google Maps API documentation and a Udemy course on map APIs in JavaScript.  
Challenges: I anticipate needing to figure out how to dynamically load map locations and handle API key security. To address this, I’ll practice with dummy data first and research security best practices for frontend applications.  
Success Criteria: If users can see a Google Maps widget in the app that dynamically updates with each run location, then I’ll consider this learning goal achieved.

## Class Diagram 

Provide a visual representation of the relationships between the main classes in your application. The class diagram should illustrate how different entities in your system are connected and how they interact. Include classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.  

---

## Class List 

List all the classes in your application. For each class, provide a brief description of its role, its methods, and its fields.  

---

## Task List with Estimated Completion Times 

Break down all tasks required to complete the project.  
- No task should exceed 4 hours (break down if longer).  
- Organize tasks logically (database setup, backend services, UI, testing, documentation).  
- Include estimates for each task to ensure proper workload management.
